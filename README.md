A repository for small pieces of code that do not fit into other repositories
or organizational schemes.

It consists mostly of code, probably adding stuff as I write it or find it on
old hard drives. Occasionally, I might find a text file worth sharing.

Unless otherwise stated, all code is released under
[GPLv3](https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).
